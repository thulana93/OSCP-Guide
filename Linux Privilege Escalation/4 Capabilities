🧩 How to Enumerate and Exploit Linux Capability Vulnerabilities
Linux capabilities, if misconfigured, can lead to privilege escalation without sudo or SUID. Here's how to manually enumerate and exploit them.

🔍 Step-by-Step Manual Enumeration
🔹 1. Find files with capabilities
        getcap -r / 2>/dev/null

Look for outputs like:
        /usr/bin/python3.10 = cap_setuid+ep
        /usr/bin/vim.basic = cap_dac_override+ep

These are binaries that may allow privilege escalation if they use capabilities insecurely.

🔹 2. Understand common dangerous capabilities
Capability	                      Exploit Potential
cap_setuid	                      Drop to root via os.setuid(0)
cap_dac_override	                Read/write restricted files
cap_sys_ptrace	                  Inject into root processes
cap_net_raw	                      Raw packet crafting, sniffing, spoofing
cap_sys_module	                  Load kernel modules (full kernel access)
cap_sys_chroot	                  Chroot jail creation (sandbox escape)

🔹 3. Exploit based on interpreter or binary behavior
        Python: use os.setuid(0) or open("/etc/shadow")
        Vim/nano: edit protected files
        GDB: attach to root process with call system("id")
        Bash (with cap_setuid): escalate with setuid(0)
