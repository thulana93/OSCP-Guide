PwnKit (CVE-2021-4034) Vulnerability Summary
PwnKit is a local privilege escalation vulnerability found in pkexec, a setuid-root binary from Polkit, affecting many Linux distributions.

‚ö†Ô∏è Root Cause
pkexec fails to properly check whether command-line arguments (argv[]) are present.
When run with no arguments, argv[1] is NULL, but the program still accesses it.
Because argv[] and envp[] (environment variables) are contiguously stored in memory, argv[1] actually points to envp[0].

üß† Vulnerability Flow
Attacker runs:
      pkexec
      (with specially crafted environment variables)
pkexec reads argv[1] ‚Üí actually reads envp[0]
It uses this value (e.g., "GCONV_PATH=.") as a command path
The resolved path is written back to argv[1] ‚Üí overwrites envp[0]
Attacker can now inject forbidden variables (e.g., LD_PRELOAD) into the environment
This leads to arbitrary code execution as root

üß± Memory Layout Comparison
Before Exploitation:
      argv[0] = "pkexec"
      argv[1] = NULL
      envp[0] = "GCONV_PATH=."
      envp[1] = "CHARSET=evil"

After Exploitation:
      argv[0] = "pkexec"
      argv[1] = "/full/path/to/evil"   ‚Üê Overwrites envp[0]
      envp[1] = "CHARSET=evil"

üõ°Ô∏è Exploit Impact
    Local users can gain root shell
    Requires no special permissions
    Works on default installations

‚úÖ Mitigation
    Apply system updates (pkexec ‚â• 0.105 patched this)
    As a temporary fix:
        chmod 0755 /usr/bin/pkexec
