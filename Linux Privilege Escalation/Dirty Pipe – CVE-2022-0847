üõ†Ô∏è Dirty Pipe ‚Äì CVE-2022-0847
Dirty Pipe is a critical Linux kernel vulnerability (5.8 to 5.16.10) that allows unprivileged users to overwrite read-only files by abusing Linux pipes and the splice() system call. It occurs due to an uninitialized flag (PIPE_BUF_FLAG_CAN_MERGE) in pipe buffers, letting attackers inject data directly into the page cache of files they can only read.

This exploit:
    Works without write permissions
    Affects read-only, immutable, and even CD-ROM mounted files
    Enables privilege escalation (e.g., inject an SSH key into /root/.ssh/authorized_keys)

üõ°Ô∏è Fixed in kernel versions 5.16.11, 5.15.25, and 5.10.102.
